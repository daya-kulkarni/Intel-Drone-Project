Progress Log:

*I will add in some notes from the previous day
7/17/19: Thursday
The drone arrived and we unpacked it at the office. It was love at first flight (which didn't happen until I figured out a glitch at home).
We also set up TeamViewer 14 in an UP^2 box in the CH7 lab so that we can keep get some necessary files. Things are looking good!
