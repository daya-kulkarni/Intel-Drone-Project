Our project is centered on the goal of using drones for identification and delivery of products. Our end goal is to have a subscription delivery system that can track a
subscribing user and deliver a payload to them. We split the project into three stages of development to help organize our planning.
Level 1: The first level of the project is to have a drone takeoff and run object detection on every frame from the camera.
Level 2: The second level is to have the drone to recognize people in a frame and check each person against the intended recipient.
Level 3: The third level is to have the drone deliver an item to an intended recipient after positively identifying them.

In this project, we focused on achieving level 1 for the demo and show the drone recognizing people in its frame and reacting with a flip. In the future, we plan to continue
the project and achieve levels 2 and 3.
